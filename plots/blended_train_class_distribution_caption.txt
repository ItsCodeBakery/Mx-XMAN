Figure: Training set class distribution for the Blended Malware Image Dataset used by Mv-XMAN.
The x-axis lists malware families in alphabetical order; the y-axis shows the number of training images per family.
This distribution characterizes inter-class imbalance, which we mitigate using a weighted sampler during training.
